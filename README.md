👋 Hey there, I’m Faith Dakwa  

🌍 Cloud Explorer | Storyteller of Servers | Architect of the Invisible

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where I turn cloud ideas into working projects and sprinkle in some creativity along the way.

🚀 What I Do  
- 🛠️ Build end-to-end AWS solutions.  
- 🌀 Experiment with Terraform, serverless apps & automation.  
- 📊 Play with FinOps dashboards like they’re game leaderboards.  
- 🎬 Create fun content where AWS services become characters.

🎨 Current Experiments  
🔹 Designing a Travel Claims Workflow
🔹 Building a Terraform Playground (IaC labs for beginners)  
🔹 Sketching an AWS "the office based" sitcom scripts identifying each service and its attributes  🎭 (yes, CloudFront has drama)

🛠️ Toolbox

🌟 A Fun Fact  
I believe every AWS service has a personality.  
S3? The manic hoarder, ready to keep any amount of data you may have just cant get enough.  
Lambda? The hyper kid that shows up, does the job, and disappears.  
CloudFront? The overachiever who always wants to be closer to you.
